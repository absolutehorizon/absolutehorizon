- 👋 Hi, I’m @absolutehorizon
- 👀 I’m interested in Ancient Roman History, Space, Art, and running.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript and C++
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing (I am learning things right now from the very basics, but in the future, who knows).
- 📫 How to reach me: At the current moment you can't. I will reach you.
